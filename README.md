An application that creates SVG Images

## Description
This a console application that takes information from the user and creates an SVG image.  

This application uses Inquirer to ask the user 4 questions:
 1. A maximum 3 character text
 2. A string identifier of a color or a Hexadecimal representaion of a color for the text
 3. A shape (Square, Circle or Triangle)
 4. A string identifier of a color or a Hexadecimal represenation of a color for the shape

 With these inputs from the user, the application will generate a 300x200 SVG image.  That can be viewed using a web browser.

 ## Usage

 Below is a link to a video of the walkthrough of the application:
